Sample shape manipulation (`scintillometry.shaping`)
****************************************************

`~scintillometry.shaping` contains tasks to change the sample shape, e.g., to
ensure frequency and polarization are on different axes in preparation for
calculating polarized powers and cross products.  The changes can be done
using a user-defined function or with pre-defined implementations for
reshaping, transposition and slicing.
