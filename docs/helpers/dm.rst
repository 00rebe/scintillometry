Dispersion Measure (`scintillometry.dm`)
****************************************

Radio waves travelling through ionized interstellar medium experience a
frequency-dependent slowing of the signal group velocity known as dispersion.
The `~scintillometry.dm` module provides functionality for storing and
utilizing the dispersion measure, which is related to the delay in arrival time
of radio signals due to the cumulative effects of dispersion.
